# Floating-Ellipse-Simulations
This repository contains Python simulations of a floating ellipse subjected to Archimedean buoyant forces. The simulations are implemented as Jupyter notebooks and model different scenarios, including:

    Fixed rotation angles
    Fixed heights (with adjustable parameters)
    Full motion (both vertical displacement and rotation)

Additionally, the dimensions of the ellipse can be modified for each case.
