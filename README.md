# Floating-Ellipse-Simulations
This repository contains Python simulations of a floating ellipse subjected to Archimedean buoyant forces. The simulations are implemented as Jupyter notebooks and model different scenarios with adjustable parameters, including:

- Fixed rotation angles
- Fixed heights
- Full motion (both vertical displacement and rotation)

Additionally, the dimensions of the ellipse can be modified for each case.
